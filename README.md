# <img src="img/restaurant.png" width="30" height="30"> Welcome to Restaurant Roulette (BCSHacks 2022)
A web application that generates a random restaurant recommendation given a location, specified radius and food-category.
 
Wanna go out and grab a bite but can never decide where? This application is perfect for you. Enter your location, the type of food your feeling (or nothing if you don't know!), how far you're willing to travel (radius), and let's play a game of Restaurant Roulette. Happy food hunting.

# Usage
You must enter a location (address, city, country) and radius (km). Food category is optional.

Note: Usage constraints largely revolve around the available data Google Maps and Yelp have for restaurants. Certain locations will be signficantly less serviced.
