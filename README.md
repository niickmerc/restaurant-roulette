# <img src="img/restaurant.png" width="30" height="30"> Welcome to Restaurant Roulette: _I'm Feeling Hungry_ (BCSHacks 2022)
A simple web-application that generates a random restaurant recommendation given a location, specified radius and food-category. We utilized the Yelp-Fusion API and Google Maps to build our application.
 
Wanna go out and grab a bite but can never decide where? This application is perfect for you. Enter your location, the type of food your feeling (or nothing if you don't know!), how far you're willing to travel (radius), and let's play a game of Restaurant Roulette. Voila! There's even a Google Maps link for your convenience. Happy food hunting.

# Usage
Requires Node.js to be installed. 

In terminal, run `node index.js` in the main `/restaurant-roulette-main` directory. Then open up your browser and go to `localhost:3000`.
Make sure all dependencies are installed.

You must enter a location (address, city, country). Radius (km) and food category are optional.

Note: Usage constraints largely revolve around the available data Google Maps and Yelp have for restaurants. Certain locations will be signficantly less serviced.
